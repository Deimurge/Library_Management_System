The code uses the java.time package to handle date and time operations. 
The LocalDate class is used to represent the borrow and return dates of books.
The ChronoUnit class is used to calculate the number of days between the borrow and return dates.
The Book class extends the Thread class to enable multithreading. 
The run() method is overridden to perform the task of checking for overdue books and fining users.
The code uses streams to read and write data from/to files.
The BufferedReader and BufferedWriter classes are used to read from and write to the library.txt file, respectively
The Book class is made to extend the Thread class, and the run() method is overridden to perform the task of checking for overdue books and fining users. 
This allows the program to run multiple threads concurrently, improving performance.
